Gaia is a European space mission providing astrometry, photometry, and
spectroscopy of more than 1000 million stars in the Milky Way. Also data for
significant samples of extragalactic and Solar system objects is made
available. The Gaia Archive contains deduced positions, parallaxes, proper
motions, radial velocities, and brightnesses. Complementary information on
multiplicity, photometric variability, and astrophysical parameters is provided
for a large fraction of sources.
